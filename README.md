# Tech Salary Negotiation Guide 2026

> Complete guide to negotiating your tech job offer — base, equity, bonus strategies.

## Salary Negotiation Strategies

### Know Your Worth

Before negotiating, research compensation at your target company:

| Level | Base Salary (US) | Total Comp Range |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| New Grad / L3 | $100K - $150K | $150K - $250K |
| Mid-Level / L4 | $140K - $200K | $250K - $400K |
| Senior / L5 | $180K - $280K | $350K - $600K |
| Staff / L6 | $220K - $350K | $500K - $900K |

*Ranges vary significantly by company, location, and specialization.*

### Negotiation Framework

1. **Never give a number first** — Let the company make the initial offer
2. **Always negotiate** — Companies expect it; first offers are rarely final
3. **Negotiate the full package** — Base, equity, signing bonus, relocation, start date
4. **Use competing offers** — Multiple offers = strongest negotiating position
5. **Be professional** — Express enthusiasm while advocating for fair compensation
6. **Get it in writing** — Verbal offers mean nothing; wait for the offer letter

### Key Phrases

| Situation | What to Say |
|-----------|------------|
| Asked for salary expectations | "I'd like to understand the full scope of the role before discussing compensation" |
| Received an offer | "Thank you! I'm excited about this opportunity. I'd like some time to review the complete package" |
| Counter-offering | "Based on my research and competing offers, I was hoping we could explore a base of $X with Y RSUs" |
| Final negotiation | "If we can get to $X total comp, I'm ready to sign today" |
